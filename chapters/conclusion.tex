All in all, I can say that my internship in there were significantly more 
fruitful than my previous internshipt, mostly because the stakes were just 
higher. However, the company didn't really adopt agile or any other popular

with their own method where it doesn't necessarily pressure the staff 
while still making a healthy balance of speed and quality.
